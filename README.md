## Introduction
The **Eyebrow Symmetry App** is a mobile application designed to measure and improve the symmetry of eyebrows using advanced machine learning techniques. The app leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to provide real-time symmetry detection with a user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to achieve perfect eyebrow symmetry.

## Features
- Real-time eyebrow symmetry detection
- High accuracy with a 96.4% success rate
- Intuitive user interface built with Kotlin
- Mobile-optimized machine learning model
- Supports both photos and live camera input

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Mobile Development:** Kotlin, XML, Jetpack Compose
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
